## Typical usage scenario
Determine latitude and longitude based on an address. With these coordinates it becomes possible to view a location on a Google map, using the Mendix Google Maps Widget.

## Configuration
The module contains snippets and example pages which you can use in your project. The example pages are excluded from the project by default in order to reduce the dependency on layouts (which might not be available in your project).
You can find the Snippets in the '_Use me' folder in the project navigation. You can find the example pages in '_Example pages' folder in the project navigation.

#### Constants
Optionally you can add an API Key of your Google project. The API key allows you to monitor your application's API usage in the Google API Console.

#### Snippets
Copy the snippets which you would like to use to a page in your project.

#### Example pages
Copy the example pages which you would like to use in your project to a module in your project structure. (E.g MyFirstModule) Include the page in your project by right-clicking the page in the project navigation and clicking 'Include in project'.
